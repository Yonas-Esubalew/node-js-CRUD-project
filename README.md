In this project you will assume the role of a back-end developer working for an online retailer selling books.this server-side application that stores, retrieves and manages book ratings and reviews.
this server-side application is required to provide the following features and capabilities to allow users to:
Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the book’s ISBN code, author names and titles
Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
Register as a new user of the application
Login to the application
Add a new review for a book (logged in users only)
Modify a book review (logged in users can modify only their own reviews)
Delete a book review (logged in users can delete only their own reviews)
(Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously
As is the case with most software development projects, different people in the team work on different parts of the application.
Another front-end developer in your team is working on the web-based client-side application that will communicate with your server-side application using REST. 
Therefore your job is to implement your server-side application as a RESTful web service.
A software architect on your team has written the skeleton code for your server-side application using Node.js and Express.js.

Task 1: Get the book list available in the shop.
Task 2: Get the books based on ISBN.

Task 6: Register New user
Task 7: Login as a Registered user
